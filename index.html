            <h1 class="endless">ENDLESS</h1>
            Endless is a catalogue of work and backlog of previous projects, as well as a hub for resources I find useful and/or interesting.
            I wanted a platform to better explain my ideas and reasoning for personal projects, more than just what lives on Github.
            I wanted to have everything as a stream of ideas that were all in one place - "endless".
            It is updated periodically with any new projects as well as changes to old work I may have revisited.
            Currently this exists through a subdomain of my website, however I am looking to migrate this elsewhere soon.

            <h2>Kogan Coding Recruitment Challenge</h2>
            Invited to participate in a recruitment challenge for Kogan, an Australian congolmerate, for the role of a developer.
            The challenge consisted of a single API endpoint that would have to be used in order to retrieve and handle a mock
            AWS JSON object, which would then be filtered based on a certain property. The challenge wanted a calculation of the average cubic
            weight of all air conditing units present in the endpoint.
            <p></p>
            Although I did not progress further, the project was enjoyable and taught me more about handling API endpoint objects.
            It is worth noting that the site is currently broken, due to security performance issues, given that the enpoint
            provided was with HTTP rather than HTTPS. I may come back to this in the future to try and edit my approach in order
            to make it functional again, however it is not a priority of mine at this current stage.
            <h2>'goodbye' - font updater project</h2>
            Personal project focused on experimenting with JavaScript driven CSS changes, specifically changing text elements, including font families
            and replacing the words automatically. The words are fed from an array of variations of 'goodbye' in a variety of different languages.
            The implementation is still very basic/naive. I am looking to develop this idea further in efforts to push for more of an
            automated approach.
            <p></p>
            In future, I want to develop a similar idea which is much more polished and thorough. The elements should be able to be added to/removed from
            easily without a need for manual array changes. On top of this, the current design struggles with media design queries, which is an area I would love
            to work on and learn more about, as well as building upon more general CSS knowledge.
            <h2>'nights' - onlick and button hover experiments</h2>
            Testing basic button onclick and hover functionality with replacing HTML/CSS elements. I wanted something that implemented buttons with both
            onclick and hover changes. The button retrieves it's contents from a pre-defined array which, upon reaching it's end, changes to a 'final' text
            element which marks that you have reached the end of the array. After clicking this final button once more, the page resets and the array
            parsing begins again.
            <p></p>
            The design could be much more efficient, and I wish to develop another version of this same idea however without taking such a naive approach.
            Another stipulation I have with this project is the lack of responsive mobile design/functionality. Coming back to this in the future
            to hopefully change and redesign this for both desktop and mobile compatability.
            <h2>'redthread' - count-up timer implementation</h2>
            One of the first personal projects I worked on. It took inspiration from a few basic count-up timer designs from codepen, however the
            majority of it's design can be found <a href="https://guwii.com/bytes/count-date-time-javascript/">here</a>. 
            The purpose of the design was to be able to count-up indefinitely given a certain date as a start point. There did exist certain
            other implementations of the same design, yet most did not run indefinitely (would always start from onload at a value of 0) and would only run
            using retrieval of the current date. I also wished to include a milliseconds value to the timer, which I could not find in anyone else's designs.
            The runner gif was taken from taking multiple frames from a section of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHMdv2D7ndc">this</a> video, where I
            used 8 frames, carving out the running figure, redesigning and compiling the images, eventually using this as a model for my runner.
            <p></p>
            The timer is counting from a date which has significant sentimental value to me, and the idea was structured around the Chinese/Japanese legend
            regarding the red thread of fate. The initial intent was to have a silhoutte running chasing a red thread, with the timer captioned by: 
            "He has been chasing his red thread for ____ amount of time" etc. The site is important more as a personal milestone rather than anything
            else, and so although I would still like to make some design improvements, as long it remains functional I will be happy.
