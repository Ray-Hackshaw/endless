# Endless
An 'endless' timeline resource and backlog for previous work, with explanations for each piece.
The aim was to have all of my previous projects and work in one place, with the ability to scroll down the entire page from start to finish with no breaks.

The site is incomplete and requires a lot of work to get to where I want it to be, including more comprehensive project descriptions, a vertical/horizontal scrolling toggle as well as overall polishing and UX changes.

Some more projects would of course be nice too!
